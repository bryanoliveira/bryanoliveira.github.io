3D Force simulator using only [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s point() and line() functions. Uses Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) to render lines between two points, Scan Line to render polygons, normal calculation to determine faces to render in 3D space and Newtonian physics. Written in Java.

The program interface allows for real-time selection, positioning, rotation, scaling and acceleration of objects. In a [previous version](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/processing-3d-force-simulator/blob/fc899000baecf513cc3da4b38ab104cd4de260f7/Simulator/Projections.pde) it also supported selecting between Cavalier, Cabinet, Isometric, Perspective-Z and Perspective-XZ projections.

## Usage

-   Clone this repository
-   Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)
-   Open this project with Processing IDE or execute `processing-java --sketch=Simulator --force --run` in a CLI.
