Hi! This is the development repo of [Pequi Mec칙nico](https://www.facebook.com/NucleoPMec/) - INF's **Very Small Size Soccer Team**. Our team comprises several courses (Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Computer Science), all from Federal University of Goi치s - [UFG](https://www.ufg.br/) - Goi칙nia. Our repository is open because we understand that our greatest job is to add our research and knowledge to the academic and industrial world.

You can find our Team Description Paper [here](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/PY-VSSS-INF/blob/master/docs/TDP%20VSSS%20INF%202018.pdf). We are open to answer any questions and suggestions through our email pequimecanicoufg@gmail.com.

## Features

-   Isolated modules for vision, strategy, control, communication, and interface
-   High-fidelity simulator made with MuJoCo
-   Qt interface

> Our simulator running two instances of the same control system. Green arrows indicate the robot's movement direction (given by the vector field), and blue, yellow, and red arrows indicate goalie, defender and attacker's targets.

## Usage

### Dependencies

Our code runs on all Python3-supported OS's (we recommend Python 3.4). To start using our software, you must install all requirements described on our requirements.txt file. You can easily do that by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

We use MuJoCo as our simulation engine. Unfortunately, as MuJoCo is not free software, you must grab your license [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html) to run our simulator.

### Executing

To open the GUI we use on our competitions, run:

`python afrodite.py`

To open our simulator, run:

`python aether.py`
