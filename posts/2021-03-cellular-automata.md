A [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) program built with C++, CUDA and OpenGL. It's built to run on a GPU but it also supports CPU-only execution (mainly for relative speedup comparisons).

The main objective of this project is to allow scaling up to a fairly large number of cells while maintaining the code legibility and allowing for further customizations. It supports command line arguments to set up quick configs (run `./automata -h` for details) like headless mode (which is significantly faster) and initial patterns (which can be loaded from the `patterns` folder). It doesn't yet support the definition of evolution rules at runtime, but I'm working on that.

This program can currently evolve a dense & high entropy 144 million cell Conway's Game of Life grid (12000x12000) with rendering enabled with up to 15 FPS on a Ryzen 7 3700X / RTX 3080 using up to 2GB RAM and 9GB VRAM (which is the actual scaling limiter).
