[{"html":"<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cellular Automata</a> program built with C++, CUDA and OpenGL. It&#39;s built to run on a GPU but it also supports CPU-only execution (mainly for relative speedup comparisons). On the right there&#39;s an example execution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a> on a 100x100 randomly initialized grid.</p>\n<p>The main objective of this project is to allow scaling up to a reasonably large number of cells while maintaining the code legibility and allowing for further customizations. It supports command line arguments to set up quick configs (run <code>./automata -h</code> for details) like headless mode (which is significantly faster) and initial patterns (which can be loaded from the <code>patterns</code> folder). It doesn&#39;t yet support the definition of evolution rules at runtime or lattice size inference, but I&#39;m working on that.</p>\n<p>This program can currently evolve a dense &amp; high entropy 182.25 million cell Game of Life grid (13500x13500) with rendering enabled with up to 320 generations per second on a Ryzen 7 3700X / RTX 3080 using up to 200MB RAM and 8.5GB VRAM (which is the actual scaling limiter).</p>\n<p>The ability to evolve and render such large grids allows the program to run some really interesting patterns, like evolving the Game of Life <em>within</em> the Game of Life:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img class=\"text-img mw-75\" src=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata/raw/master/docs/zoom.gif\">\n</div>\n\n<p>In the GIF above we&#39;re running a 12300x12300 grid using Game of Life rules to evolve a pattern known as <a href=\"http://b3s23life.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html\">Meta-Toad</a>. It uses a grid of <a href=\"https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OTCA_metapixel\">OTCA Metapixels</a> and requires about 35 thousand generations of the underlying automaton to represent a single generation of the meta-grid. The pattern being evolved by the meta-grid is known as <a href=\"https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Toad\">Toad</a>:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img class=\"text-img\" src=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata/raw/master/docs/toad.gif\" width=\"150\">\n</div>\n\n<p>This program also supports a benchmark mode (<code>-b</code> option), which outputs the total and average evolution and rendering timings to stdout. Combined with <code>benchmark.sh</code> and <code>benchmark_visualize.ipynb</code>, it is possible to plot speedups and evolution times for different lattice sizes. Currently, the GPU implementation achieves a relative speedup of more than 3000x over the single-core CPU implementation.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata/master/docs/speedup.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"300\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryanoliveira/cellular-automata/master/docs/avg_time.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"338\">\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speedup over serial (left) and average grid evolution time (right) for lattice sizes 32x32, 64x64, ..., 8192x8192 and 1000 generations.

Reviving the classics of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, Die Zombit is a retro wave top-down shooting game with an amazing soundtrack and addictive gameplay that guarantees many hours of fun.

I&#39;ve learned a lot from this project, from software engineering to game design and a little bit of pixel art. I believe the project could be significantly improved using better design patterns, clearer abstractions and algorithmic complexity in mind.
