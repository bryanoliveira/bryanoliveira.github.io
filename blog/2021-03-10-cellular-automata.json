{"html":"<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cellular Automata</a> program built with C++, CUDA and OpenGL. It&#39;s built to run on a GPU but it also supports CPU-only execution (mainly for relative speedup comparisons).</p>\n<p>The main objective of this project is to allow scaling up to a fairly large number of cells while maintaining the code legibility and allowing for further customizations. It supports command line arguments to set up quick configs (run <code>./automata -h</code> for details) like headless mode (which is significantly faster) and initial patterns (which can be loaded from the <code>patterns</code> folder).
