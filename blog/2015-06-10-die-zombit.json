{"html":"<p>In a world overrun by zombies, you must survive as long as possible and defeat different bosses while unlocking weapons, upgrades, equipment, characters, maps and much more. Reviving the classics of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, Die Zombit is a retro wave top-down shooting game with an amazing soundtrack and addictive gameplay that guarantees many hours of fun. Check out its trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO7FSZ3TJns\">here</a>:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img class=\"text-img mw-100\" src=\"img/zombit_walter.gif\"/>\n</div>\n\n<p>I made this game during my first year in the Computer Science course, using C# and UnityScript. I&#39;ve learned a lot from this project, from software engineering to game design and a little bit of pixel art. However, I believe the project could be significantly improved using better design patterns, clearer abstractions and algorithmic complexity in mind. Yet, it is a fun game that you can <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elitgames.zombit\">download</a> (an older version) in Play Store.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img class=\"text-img mw-33\" src=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/unity-zombit/raw/master/Images/3.png\"> \n    <img class=\"text-img mw-33\" src=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/unity-zombit/raw/master/Images/2.png\"> \n    <img class=\"text-img mw-33\" src=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/unity-zombit/raw/master/Images/1.png\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"usage\">Usage</h2>\n<h3 id=\"running-a-pre-built-binary-android-and-windows-only\">Running a pre-built binary (Android and Windows only)</h3>\n<p>For the Android version, you may <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elitgames.zombit\">head to the Play Store</a>.</p>\n<p>For the Windows version, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download Die.Zombit.[version].zip from the <a href=\"https://github.com/bryanoliveira/unity-zombit/releases\">latest release</a></li>\n<li>Extract the game folder</li>\n<li>Double click to run it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"buildingrunning-from-source\">Building/running from source</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>  Install Unity3D (tested for v2019.3)</li>\n<li>  Open the project folder</li>\n<li>  Hit Play and have fun!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>This version is an unfinished project that rethinks the UI, weapon management and overall objectives.
